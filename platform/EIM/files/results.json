Branches can be merged back into the main codebase when the changes are complete.3. Pull Requests: Developers can create pull requests to propose changes to the main codebase. Other team members can review the changes, suggest modifications, and approve the changes before they are merged into the main code.4. Issues: Developers can create issues to track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks related to the project. Issues can be assigned to team members, labeled, and prioritized to help with project management.5. Collaborators: Developers can add collaborators to their repositories to work on projects together. Collaborators can push changes to the repository, create branches, and participate in code reviews.GitHub is used by millions of developers around the world and has become an essential tool for modern software development.

Homes were destroyed, crops were ruined, and many villagers were left homeless. Caleb knew he had to do something to help his friends and neighbors.He set out on a journey to the top of the tallest mountain, where it was said that a mystical rock with healing powers could be found. Despite the treacherous terrain and dangerous weather, Caleb pushed on, fueled by his determination to help those in need.After days of climbing, Caleb finally reached the summit of the mountain. There, he found the glowing rock, shimmering with a golden light. He carefully chiseled a piece from it and began his descent back to the village.When he returned, he shared the miraculous rock with the villagers. As soon as they touched it, they felt a surge of healing energy coursing through their bodies, rejuvenating their spirits and repairing the damage caused by the storm.The village was soon restored to its former glory, thanks to Caleb's selfless act of courage and compassion. From that day on, he was known as a hero, revered by all who knew him.And as for Caleb, he continued to spread kindness and love wherever he went, knowing that even the smallest act of generosity could make a world of difference.",
